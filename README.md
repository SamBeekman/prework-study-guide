## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

I built this study guide as a starting point for coding in this course and to help develop the skills i'll be using throughout it. I added some extra features that were outside the scope of what we were told to do to help solidify how this all works. I learnt a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git and how these all play an interconnected role in software development. This webpage solves the problem of digging through notes in the coursework as everything is laid out nicely on a single page.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

There are also many hyperlinks included so click on those to be redirected to the appropriate pages.
